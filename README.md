# Netflix Stock Price Forecast

The goal of this project is to use RNN and LSTM models to predict future stock prices of Netflix. The historical stock data used in this project is obtained from a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/netflix-stock-price-prediction).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Steps to Follow
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary packages
3. Run the Jupyter notebook file
4. Analyze the data and models in the notebook

## Model Types
Two models have been employed in this project to predict Netflix's stock prices:
1. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Outcome
The prediction results will be shown as a graph. The actual stock prices and predicted stock prices will be plotted and compared.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are highly encouraged. Please feel free to open issues and submit pull requests.
